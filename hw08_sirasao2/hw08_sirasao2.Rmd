# Assignment

## Exercise 1 (TV is Healthy?)

For this exercise we will use the `tvdoctor` data which can be found in the `faraway` package. After loading the `faraway` package, use `?tvdoctor` to learn about this dataset.

```{r}
library(faraway)
```

**(a)** Fit a simple linear regression with `life` as the response and `tv` as the predictor. Plot a scatterplot and add the fitting line. Check the assumptions of this model.

```{r}

life_model = lm(life~tv, data = tvdoctor)
plot (life~tv, data = tvdoctor, 
      xlab = "tv", 
      ylab= "life", pch=20, cex=3, col = "darkmagenta")
abline (life_model, lty=2, lwd=2, col="firebrick1")
plot(fitted(life_model), resid(life_model), col = "gold1",
     pch = 20, cex = 1.5, xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = "forestgreen", lwd = 2)

```

**(b)** Fit higher order polynomial models of degree 3, 5, and 7. For each, plot a fitted versus residuals plot and comment on the constant variance assumption. Based on those plots, which of these three models to you think are acceptable? Use a statistical test(s) to compare the models you just chose. Based on the test, which is preferred? Check the normality assumption of this model. Identify any influential observations of this model.

```{r}
life_model_3 = lm(life ~ tv + I(tv ^ 2) + I(tv ^ 3), data = tvdoctor)
summary(life_model_3)
anova(life_model_3)
plot(fitted(life_model_3), resid(life_model_3), col = "orange", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)
```

```{r}
life_model_5 = lm(life ~ tv + I(tv ^ 2) + I(tv ^ 3) + I(tv ^ 4) + I(tv ^ 5), data = tvdoctor)
summary(life_model_5)
anova(life_model_5)

plot(fitted(life_model_5), resid(life_model_5), col = "orange", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)
```

```{r}
life_model_7 = lm(life ~ tv + I(tv ^ 2) + I(tv ^ 3) + I(tv ^ 4) + I(tv ^ 5) + I(tv ^ 6) + I(tv ^ 7), data = tvdoctor)
summary(life_model_7)
anova(life_model_7)

plot(fitted(life_model_7), resid(life_model_7), col = "orange", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)

#Both assumptons hold. Both models can be used.
```

```{r}
#By looking at what we have, I would say life_model_5 is preferred
anova(life_model_5, life_model_7)
```

```{r}
#In order to check the normality assumption we need to chec the q-q plots. We can see it is valid.

qqnorm(resid(life_model_5), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot,life_model_5", col = "red")
qqline(resid(life_model_5), col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)

```

```{r}
#Idenitfy influencers:
large_infl = cooks.distance(life_model_5) > 4 / length(cooks.distance(life_model_5))

cooks.distance(life_model_5)[large_infl]

```
## Exercise 2 (Brains)

The data set `mammals` from the `MASS` package contains the average body weight in kilograms $(x)$ and the average brain weight in grams $(y)$ for $62$ species of land mammals. Use `?mammals` to learn more.

```{r}
library(MASS)
```

**(a)** What are the smallest and largest body weights in the dataset?

```{r}
max(mammals$body)
min(mammals$body)
```

**(b)** What are the smallest and largest brain weights in the dataset?

```{r}
min(mammals$brain)
max(mammals$brain)
```

**(c)** Plot average brain weight $(y)$ vs. the average body weight $(x)$.

```{r}
plot(mammals$brain, mammals$body, xlab = "Brain Weight", ylab = "Brain Weight")

```

**(d)** Fit a linear model with `brain` as the response and `body` as the predictor. Test for significance of regression. Do you think this is an appropriate model?

```{r}
brain_model= lm(brain~body, data=mammals)
summary(brain_model)

#It looks fine to me and I see significant regression.

```

Recall, *the log rule*: if the values of a variable range over more than one order of magnitude and the variable is strictly positive, then replacing the variable by its logarithm is likely to be helpful.


**(e)** Since the body weights do range over more than one order of magnitude and are strictly positive, we will use $\log(\text{body weight})$ as our *predictor*, with no further justification. Use the Box-Cox method to verify that $\log(\text{brain weight})$ is then a "recommended" transformation of the *response* variable. That is, verify that $\lambda = 0$ is among the "recommended" values of $\lambda$ when considering,

\[
g_\lambda(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{body weight})+\epsilon
\]

Please include the relevant plot in your results, using an appropriate zoom onto the relevant values.

```{r}
log_model= lm(brain~log(body), data=mammals)
boxcox(log_model, lambda = seq(-0.20, 0.20, by = 0.002),  plotit=TRUE)
```

**(f)** Fit the model justified in part **(e)**. That is fit a model with $\log(\text{brain weight})$ as the response and $\log(\text{body weight})$ as a predictor. Plot $\log(\text{brain weight})$ versus $\log(\text{body weight})$ and add the regression line to the plot. Does a linear relationship seem to be appropriate here?

```{r}
has_both_model = lm(log(brain)~log(body), data= mammals)
plot(log(brain)~log(body), data=mammals, xlab="log(body)", ylab= "log(brain)")
abline(has_both_model, lty=2, lwd=2, col="red" )

#A linear relationship is appropriate
```

**(g)** Use a Q-Q plot to check the normality of the errors for the model fit in part **(f)**.

```{r}
qqnorm(resid(has_both_model), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot, has_both_model", col = "green")
qqline(resid(has_both_model), col = "gold3", lwd = 2)

#the distribution is normal
```

**(h)** Use the model from part **(f)** to predict the brain weight of a male Pikachu which has a body weight 13.4 pounds. (Pikachu would be mammals, right?) Construct a 99% prediction interval.

```{r}
pikachu= data.frame(body=6.078138)

predict.lm(has_both_model, pikachu, interval = "prediction", level = 0.99)
exp(predict.lm(has_both_model,pikachu, interval = "prediction", level = 0.99))
```

## Exercise 3 (EPA Emissions Data, revisited)

For this exercise we will again use the data stored in [`epa2015.csv`](epa2015.csv) which we saw in HW06. It contains detailed descriptions of 4,411 vehicles manufactured in 2015 used for fuel economy testing [as performed by the Environment Protection Agency]( https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/tcldata.htm).

**(a)** Recall the model we had finished with last time:

```{r}
epa2015 <- read.csv("~/Downloads/epa2015.csv")

co2_int = lm(CO2 ~ horse * type, data = epa2015)
```

Which looked like this:

```{r}
plot(CO2 ~ horse, data = epa2015, col = type)

int_coef = summary(co2_int)$coef[,1]

int_both    = int_coef[1]
int_car     = int_coef[1] + int_coef[3]
int_truck   = int_coef[1] + int_coef[4]

slope_both  = int_coef[2]
slope_car   = int_coef[2] + int_coef[5]
slope_truck = int_coef[2] + int_coef[6]

abline(int_both, slope_both, lwd = 3, col = "black")
abline(int_car, slope_car, lwd = 3, col = "red")
abline(int_truck, slope_truck, lwd = 3, col = "green")
```

Create a fitted vs residuals plot for this model. Do you believe the constant variance assumption has been violated?

```{r}
plot(fitted(co2_int), resid(co2_int), col = "darkgreen", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)

#Yes it has been violated. The spread of residuals is not even at every fitted value.
```

**(b)** Fit the same model as **(a)** but with a logged response. Create a fitted vs residuals plot for this model. Compare to the previous. Do you believe the constant variance assumption has been violated? Any other assumptions?

```{r}
co2_log = lm(log(CO2) ~ horse*type, data = epa2015)
plot(fitted(co2_log), resid(co2_log), col = "darkgreen", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)
```

**(c)** Fit a model that has all of the terms from the model in **(b)** as well as a quadratic term for `horse`. Again use `log(CO2)` as the response. Create a fitted vs residuals plot for this model. Compare to the previous. Comment on model assumptions.

```{r}
shapiro.test(resid(co2_log))

#We see a low p-value. the normalilty asuumption is violated.
```

**(d)** Perform further analysis of the model fit in part **(c)**. Can you find any violations of assumptions?

```{r}
plot(fitted(co2_log), resid(co2_log), col = "darkgreen", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residual")
abline(h=0, col = "red", lwd=2)
shapiro.test(resid(co2_log))

#normality and linear assumption are violated.
```

## Exercise 4 (Bigger Is Better?)

Consider the true model,

\[
Y = 3 - 4 x + \epsilon,
\]

where $\epsilon \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 9)$.

We can simulate observations from this model. We choose a sample size of 40.

```{r}
n = 40
set.seed(42)
x = runif(n, 0 , 10)
y = 3 - 4 * x + rnorm(n, 0 , 3)
```

Consider two models, one small, one big. The small fits a SLR model. The big fits a polynomial model of degree 10.

```{r}
fit_slr = lm(y ~ x)
fit_big = lm(y ~ poly(x, 10))
```

The big model has a smaller RMSE.

```{r}
mean(resid(fit_slr) ^ 2)
mean(resid(fit_big) ^ 2)
```

However, it is not significant when compared to the small.

```{r}
anova(fit_slr, fit_big)
```

By plotting the the data and adding the two models, we see the the degree 10 polynomial is *very* wiggly. 

```{r}
plot(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 2)
abline(fit_slr, col = "darkorange", lwd = 3)
lines(seq(0, 10, 0.01), 
      predict(fit_big, newdata = data.frame(x = seq(0, 10, 0.01))), 
      col = 'dodgerblue', lwd = 3) 
```

**(a)** Use the following code after changing `uin` to your UIN.

```{r}
num_sims = 1000
rmse_slr = rep(0, num_sims)
rmse_big = rep(0, num_sims)
pval     = rep(0, num_sims)
uin = 667850670
set.seed(uin)

for (i in 1:num_sims){
  y = 3 -4 * x + rnorm(n, 0 ,3)
  fit_slr = lm(y ~x)
  fit_big = lm(y ~ poly(x, 10))
  rmse_slr[i] = mean(resid(fit_slr) ^ 2)
  rmse_big[i] = mean(resid(fit_big) ^ 2)
  pval[i] = anova(fit_slr, fit_big) [2,6]
}
```

Repeat the above process, keeping `x` the same, the re-generating `y` and fitting the SLR and big models `1000` times. Each time, store the RMSE of each model, p-value for comparing the two. (In the appropriate variables defined above.)


**(b)** What proportion of the RMSEs of the SLR model are smaller than the big model?

```{r}
mean(rmse_slr<rmse_big)

```

**(c)** What proportion of the p-values are less than 0.05?

```{r}
mean(pval<0.05)

```

**(d)** Do you think bigger is better?

```{r}
#No. If we see the RMSE values from the big model are smaller than the ones in the smqaller one. Also smaller differences between actual and predicted values call for most fair predictions.
```
